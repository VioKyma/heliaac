#Notes about current state

Heli body
 * Old helicopter body is commented out
 * New one is there (best to switch to wireframe, and click to move camera, heli is not yet positioned properly)
 * Tail still needs to be put in the correct spot - but thought I would upload so everyone could have a look and make comments

-----

 * Added iostream for testing
 * Blade rotation doesn't increment slowly when held (?)
 * Helicopter can not move in any way until at full speed, if you want to change this for testing purposes easiest thing is to just set bool helicopterOn to true

-----

 * I had a look on one of my favorite sites and found this: 
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_mesh
 * This leads me to assume that you could write your own mesh object or something. Then I found this page:
 http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/SUN/mesh_array.txt
 * Haven't had a good look, but might be worth using, just depends if it's worth the effort I spose.

 *hey guys, I thought you would be more likely to read this than anything else. I cant come to the prac or anything today, I'm sick and going to the docs.

 * Sorry I didn't make it in today either, Xander didn't go to sleep til 6am and I slept through my alarm (which doesn't really surprise me - probably should have just stayed awake) -- Chris
