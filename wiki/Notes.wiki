#Notes about current state

Heli body
 * Old helicopter body is commented out
 * New one is there (best to switch to wireframe, and click to move camera, heli is not yet positioned properly)
 * Tail still needs to be put in the correct spot - but thought I would upload so everyone could have a look and make comments

  * I had a look on one of my favorite sites and found this:

-----

 * Added iostream for testing
 * Blade rotation doesn't increment slowly when held (?)
 * Helicopter can not move in any way until at full speed, if you want to change this for testing purposes easiest thing is to just set bool helicopterOn to true
